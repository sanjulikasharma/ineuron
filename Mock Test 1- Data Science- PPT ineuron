17. Write a function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the input list. Use list comprehension to solve this problem.

def even_list(L): 
    even_L =[]
    for i in L: 

        if i%2 == 0: 
            even_L.append(i)
            i=i+1

    return even_L 

even_num_in_list = even_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
even_num_in_list
